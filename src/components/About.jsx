            <div>
              <p>I have a huge passion for technology and business, which led me to undertake my degree in computer science and business
                in Trinity College Dublin. I have a strong foundation in many programming languages. Through college I learned Java, C# and C. In addition, through 
                the startup I have been involved in in the last year 'YourTutor', I have adapted to other languages such as Vue, HTML and CSS. 
                By working with YourTutor it also built my knowledge of business.</p>
